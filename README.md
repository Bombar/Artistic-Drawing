# Artistic-Drawing
This a sort of of tunnel that could also be viewed as a cone depending the perspective it is viewed from
I chose this design because (1) I didn't know exacly what I wanted to make so I chose the idea of circles and went from there and (2) I didn't went something to boring but not something too hard
